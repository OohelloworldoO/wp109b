        Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin) is an advanced transformation assumed by members and hybrids of the Saiyan race with sufficient amounts of S-Cells in the Dragon Ball franchise. Earthlings (of Saiyan heritage) in Dragon Ball Online can also assume the transformation by wishing to have their dormant Saiyan powers unlocked.

The Super Saiyan form first premiered in April 1991, within chapter 317 of the Dragon Ball manga, entitled "Life or Death". It also made its anime debut in 1991, first appearing in Dragon Ball Z episode 95, "Transformed at Last". Within Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, three further powered up transformations: the second[16][17] and third[18][19] forms succeed Super Saiyan, while the premier form also has two additional graded states[20] that focus on power, and also the final form[21][22] which is superior to the graded forms. The original Super Saiyan form can also be mastered[23] to improve some of its traits and remove some flaws.
