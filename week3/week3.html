<pre>In ancient China,
people believed that there were ten suns that appeared in turn in the sky during the Chinese ten-day week. 
Each day the ten suns would travel with their mother, the goddess Xi He, to the Valley of the Light in the East. 
There, Xi He would wash her children in the lake and put them in the branches of an enormous mulberry tree called fu-sang.
From the tree, only one sun would move off into the sky for a journey of one day, to reach the mount Yen-Tzu in the Far West.</pre>
